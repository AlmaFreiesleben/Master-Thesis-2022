# Complete Coverage Path Planning of underwater hull cleaning robot, Lappa, on intricate hulls

The ocean has always been utilized to do shipping, traveling, and exploring. This has led to a maritime industry that spans from investigating the ocean bottom, trade shipping, the construction of wind turbines, and bridges. All of these have the underwater environment in common. The underwater environment poses several challenges, such as exposing all surfaces to fouling. To perform optimally several of the aforementioned industries deploy structures underwater that needs to be investigated and cleaned. This has been done by diving companies, however, the utilization of robots shows great prospects. This paper investigates algorithms for obtaining complete coverage, so-called Complete Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) algorithms, in the specific case of hull cleaning. This is done by utilizing a specific robot, Lappa. Lappa has a non-standard design, so this paper analyses the movement of Lappa, aiming at implementing and testing algorithms for complete coverage.
